        <b>Background</b>
      </h4>
      <p>When we are injured on our daily lives, blood clotting occurs in damaged blood vessels. This blood clotting system is divided into two steps: primary hemostasis and secondary hemostasis. Proper blood clotting is induced by complex signal pathways. It is reported that in particular, secondary hemostasis does not occur in wounds that are smaller than a certain size, and the appearance of blood clotting is greatly different. [literture] 
<br>However, if this signal pathway is defective, blood clotting does not function well, and various diseases can be caused. One of the diseases is hemophilia. Hemophilia is caused by deficiencies in blood coagulation factors such as factor VIII and factor VIIIIXVWF, which play an important role in the blood clotting cascade. For hemophilia, current treatment is performed by administering a deficient protein as a preparation. Disadvantages of this preparation include the occurrence of inhibitors and the possibility of viral infection. When a coagulation factor is administered, the coagulation factor is regarded as a foreign substance in the body, so an inhibitor of the factor is generated, and thus the effect of the preparation may be weakened. Although there is a definitive treatment for inhibitors, but the treatment is expensive. Also, because a quarter of the currently used preparations are derived from blood donation, the possibility of viral infection cannot be denied. 
<br>Therefore, we focused on methods that do not use immune cascade reactions which is induced by blood coagulation factors. By achieving non-linear aggregation that responds to signals above a certain level, it is possible to artificially mimic the blood clotting reaction.

        <b>Objective</b>
      </h4>   
     <p>The object of our project is to make a nano-scale swarm robot which can amplify the target DNA under the isothermal condition and detect them by the logic gate.<br>
In conventional DNA amplification, high temperature cycles are necessary. However, high temperature cycles are inconvenient in vivo nor in vitro in some cases. For example, accurate detection and quantitative assay at high temperature can be difficult because of cell dying and enzyme deactivation. On the other hand, isothermal amplification and sensing enables us to detect DNA strands without killing cells or protein denaturation. Moreover, there is a merit in terms of engineering. Generally, PCR consumes large amount of energy because it repeats extreme heating and cooling. In contrast, isothermal amplification is the reaction at constant temperature, so power consumption becomes low. Also, it gives us the possibility of new device for amplification of the specific DNA sequence. If isothermal amplification is realized, amplification device can be made of low melting point materials such like plastic.<br>
Additionally, the novelty of our swarm robot is the way of increasing and visualizing the signal. There are two steps of increase. The first step is the amplification of the DNA. Utilizing the elongation by polymerase and the cutting by nicking enzyme, DNA strands as signal are amplified. The second step is aggregation. DNA signal is converted into aggregation of beads, and the volume of fluorescence increase. Through these processes, we can detect even low concentrations of DNA.<br>
As described above, our objective nano-scale swarm robot is worth developing because of its isothermal amplification and high sensitivity. </p>
