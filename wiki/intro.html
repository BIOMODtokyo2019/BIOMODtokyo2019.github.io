        <b>Background</b>
      </h4>
      <p>Recently, swarm robotics has been gathering attention because swarm robots are more flexible and autonomous than single robots in many cases. The movement of swarm robots was inspired by the group behavior of animals such as ants and fish. For example, a research group in Harvard University is trying to develop the  ‘thousand-robot swarm'. In this system, more than 1000 robots form a programmed figure autonomously.<br>
Swarm robots can be useful in many fields, and one of these fields is medicine. By administering the robots into our body, many kinds of data can be taken, and swarm robots can assist fertilization and delivering drugs. However, it is difficult to realize nano-scale electrical robots which are needed for application into medicine. Additionally, the robots should give complicated responses for functioning in vivo. Therefore, we suggest nano-scale swarm robots made of biomolecules. Biomolecules such as DNA are small enough to make nano-scale robots, and DNA strands enable the robots to move complicatedly and logically because of the complementary binding.<br>
In previous research, the convenience of molecular sensing, using the aggregation of gold nano particles with a surface modified with DNA strands, was indicated. By using this technology, higher sensitivity is realized. In our project, swarm robots are made of beads and DNA strands, and more practical swarm movement was set as the objective of the research.<br><br>

        <b>Objective</b>
      </h4>   
     <p>The object of our project is to make a nano-scale swarm robot which can amplify the target DNA under the isothermal condition and detect them by the logic gate.<br>
In conventional DNA amplification, high temperature cycles are necessary. However, high temperature cycles are inconvenient in vivo nor in vitro in some cases. For example, accurate detection and quantitative assay at high temperature can be difficult because of cell dying and enzyme deactivation. On the other hand, isothermal amplification and sensing enables us to detect DNA strands without killing cells or protein denaturation. Moreover, there is a merit in terms of engineering. Generally, PCR consumes large amount of energy because it repeats extreme heating and cooling. In contrast, isothermal amplification is the reaction at constant temperature, so power consumption becomes low. Also, it gives us the possibility of new device for amplification of the specific DNA sequence. If isothermal amplification is realized, amplification device can be made of low melting point materials such like plastic.<br>
Additionally, the novelty of our swarm robot is the way of increasing and visualizing the signal. There are two steps of increase. The first step is the amplification of the DNA. Utilizing the elongation by polymerase and the cutting by nicking enzyme, DNA strands as signal are amplified. The second step is aggregation. DNA signal is converted into aggregation of beads, and the volume of fluorescence increase. Through these processes, we can detect even low concentrations of DNA.<br>
As described above, our objective nano-scale swarm robot is worth developing because of its isothermal amplification and high sensitivity. </p>
