The enlarged view is also shown in the lower part of this figure.<br><br>The amount of fluorescence was clearly increased in α strand + β strand solutions compared with ones in only α strand or β strand solutions. In control solution few fluorescence was detected. Therefore, PEN DNA toolbox was correctly functioned about two strands, so strand α was conversed to linker AND 1, strand β was conversed to linker AND 2. Furthermore, created two linkers (linker AND 1, linker AND 2) bonded complementary.</p>

	    <p>Fig.8 Microscopic images of each solution after incubation. Scale bar= 80 µm.<br><br>When using 10 nM template α to linker, this series of systems works and beads aggregated, but there is little aggregations when using the other concentration of template α to linker. It is found that in 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM and 0 nM of template α to linker, 10 nM of is the most appropriate concentration. In regard to 100 nM, too much template α to linker inhibits the amplification of α by template α to α, so template α to linker does not work well. In regard to 1 nM, too little template α to linker does not produce linker much. Note that as little as 1 nM of X strand can be amplified and observed visibly in the form of aggregation.</p>
